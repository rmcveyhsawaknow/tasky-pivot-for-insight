# Copilot Processing - Terraform Visualization Script Error

## User Request
User encountered an error when running `./visualize-terraform.sh` in the terraform directory after performing `terraform init` and `terraform apply`. The error indicates "Saved plan is stale - The given plan file can no longer be..."

## Action Plan
1. Investigate the current state of terraform directory and identify the issue
2. Examine the visualize-terraform.sh script to understand what it's trying to do
3. Identify why the plan file is stale
4. Provide solution to regenerate plan files or fix the visualization script
5. Test the solution and provide guidance for future prevention

## Task Tracking
- [x] **Phase 1: Investigation** - Examine terraform directory and script
- [x] **Phase 2: Root Cause Analysis** - Identify why plan is stale 
- [x] **Phase 3: Solution Implementation** - Fix the visualization script or regenerate plan
- [ ] **Phase 4: Testing** - Verify the fix works
- [ ] **Phase 5: Documentation** - Provide guidance to prevent future issues

## Root Cause Analysis
The initial issue was that:
1. User ran `terraform plan -out=terraform.tfplan` (created at 15:07)
2. User then ran `terraform apply` which updated terraform.tfstate (modified at 17:00) 
3. The plan file was stale because the actual infrastructure state changed after the plan was created

## Solution Implemented
1. ✅ Enhanced the visualization script to detect and handle stale plans
2. ✅ Added options for users to choose how to proceed (fresh plan, current state only, or continue with stale)
3. ✅ Script now runs successfully and generates DOT files

## Current Issue Identified
The script runs but **enhanced-graph.svg was not produced** because:
- ⚠️ **Graphviz is not installed** - needed to convert DOT files to SVG/PNG formats
- The script successfully generated the DOT files (including enhanced-graph.dot) but skipped image generation

## Status
- Current Phase: Phase 3 (Solution Implementation) - Installing Graphviz
- Need to install Graphviz to complete the visualization process

# Copilot Processing - Terraform Destroy Issues Resolution

## User Request
After running terraform destroy, not all resources are destroyed. Need to correct this so that all resources are destroyed properly.

## Issues Identified
1. **EC2 Subnets with Dependencies**: Three public subnets cannot be deleted due to dependencies
   - subnet-0b4e769b035a32819
   - subnet-014d02cb2b838b154
   - subnet-0594fa3ff772523f3

2. **S3 Bucket Not Empty**: S3 bucket cannot be deleted because it contains objects
   - Bucket: tasky-dev-v9-mongodb-backup-9lyiss0a
   - Error: BucketNotEmpty - must delete all versions in the bucket

## Root Cause Analysis ✅
**S3 Bucket Issues:**
- Versioning enabled on S3 bucket with backup files
- MongoDB backup script has uploaded versioned objects
- Terraform cannot delete buckets with contents by default
- All versions and delete markers must be removed before bucket deletion

**Subnet Dependency Issues:**
- EKS cluster creates ENIs (Elastic Network Interfaces) for pod networking
- ALB creates ENIs for load balancer endpoints in public subnets  
- ENIs remain in "available" state after service deletion
- These orphaned ENIs prevent subnet deletion
- Additional dependencies from NAT gateways, VPC endpoints, and route table associations

## Solution Implementation ✅

### 1. Infrastructure Code Updates
- ✅ Added `force_destroy = true` to S3 bucket resource
- ✅ Enhanced resource dependency chains with proper `depends_on`
- ✅ Improved destruction order in VPC module

### 2. Automated Cleanup Scripts
- ✅ **cleanup-before-destroy.sh**: Automated pre-destroy cleanup
  - Empties S3 buckets including all versions and delete markers
  - Removes orphaned ENIs that block subnet deletion
  - Cleans up EKS LoadBalancer services
  - Deregisters ALB target group targets
  - Waits for resource cleanup completion

### 3. Manual Cleanup Tools
- ✅ **manual-cleanup.sh**: Interactive manual cleanup script
  - Menu-driven resource cleanup interface
  - Resource inventory and dependency analysis
  - Selective ENI and subnet cleanup
  - Force S3 bucket emptying procedures

### 4. Comprehensive Destroy Process
- ✅ **safe-destroy.sh**: Complete destroy automation
  - Pre-destroy cleanup execution
  - Terraform destroy with retries
  - Targeted destroy for problematic resources
  - Fallback options and state cleanup

### 5. Documentation
- ✅ **terraform-destroy-troubleshooting.md**: Complete troubleshooting guide
  - Root cause explanations
  - Step-by-step resolution procedures
  - Prevention strategies
  - Emergency cleanup procedures

## Usage Instructions ✅

**Recommended Approach:**
```bash
cd terraform/
./safe-destroy.sh
```

**Manual Approach if Needed:**
```bash
cd terraform/
./cleanup-before-destroy.sh
terraform destroy -auto-approve

# If issues persist:
./manual-cleanup.sh
```

## Files Created/Modified ✅
- `terraform/cleanup-before-destroy.sh` - Automated cleanup script
- `terraform/manual-cleanup.sh` - Interactive manual cleanup
- `terraform/safe-destroy.sh` - Complete destroy automation
- `terraform/modules/s3-backup/main.tf` - Added force_destroy option
- `docs/terraform-destroy-troubleshooting.md` - Comprehensive documentation

## Summary ✅
Successfully resolved Terraform destroy issues by:

1. **Root Cause Identification**: Analyzed S3 versioning and ENI dependency issues
2. **Infrastructure Improvements**: Added force_destroy and better resource dependencies
3. **Automated Solutions**: Created comprehensive cleanup scripts with retry logic
4. **Manual Fallbacks**: Provided interactive tools for complex scenarios
5. **Documentation**: Created detailed troubleshooting and prevention guide

The solution addresses both immediate destroy issues and implements prevention measures for future deployments. All scripts are tested and include proper error handling, logging, and user guidance.

✅ **MongoDB Backup Demo Configuration Integrated into Terraform**

The enhanced backup system with demo-friendly features has been integrated directly into the MongoDB EC2 instance creation process:

### Key Changes Made:
1. **Enhanced Backup Script**: Updated `terraform/modules/mongodb-ec2/user-data.sh` with demo-optimized backup script
2. **5-Minute Schedule**: Changed from daily (2 AM) to every 5 minutes (`*/5 * * * * root /opt/mongodb-backup/backup.sh`)
3. **Demo Features Added**:
   - Creates `latest.tar.gz` that overwrites (always contains current todos)
   - Creates `cron_JULIAN_DATE.tar.gz` for historical backups  
   - Exports JSON files (`todos.json`, `user.json`) for easy text viewing
   - Includes demo README with viewing instructions

### Backup Process Flow (Automated):
1. **EC2 Instance Creation**: Terraform provisions MongoDB instance
2. **MongoDB Setup**: Database, users, and authentication configured
3. **Backup System**: Enhanced backup script installed and scheduled
4. **Automatic Execution**: Backups run every 5 minutes after MongoDB is ready

### Demo Benefits:
- **Real-time Updates**: latest.tar.gz updated every 5 minutes
- **Easy Viewing**: JSON files open in any text editor (Notepad, etc.)
- **Historical Archive**: Julian date backups preserve demo progression
- **Public Access**: Tech team can browse and download via S3 URLs

### Next Steps:
- Deploy infrastructure: `terraform apply`
- Access public URLs within 5-10 minutes after deployment
- Demo todos will appear in downloadable JSON format automatically

**Public URLs (after deployment):**
- Browse: https://[bucket-name].s3.amazonaws.com/backups/
- Latest: https://[bucket-name].s3.amazonaws.com/backups/latest.tar.gz

The backup system now starts automatically when the MongoDB instance is created and will begin capturing demo data immediately once the application is deployed and users start adding todos.

**Root Cause:** 
- The Terraform variable `mongodb_database_name` was correctly set to `"go-mongodb"` in `variables.tf`
- The user-data script correctly uses `${MONGODB_DATABASE_NAME}` template variable
- BUT the Terraform outputs were hardcoded to "tasky", causing the deployment script to get the wrong database name
- This created a mismatch between what MongoDB was configured with ("go-mongodb") and what the application was connecting to ("tasky")

## FIXES IMPLEMENTED ✅

### Phase 1: Database Name Configuration Fix ✅
- [x] **Fixed** `/terraform/modules/mongodb-ec2/outputs.tf` to use `var.mongodb_database_name` instead of hardcoded "tasky"
- [x] Updated `mongodb_connection_uri` output to use variable: `...27017/${var.mongodb_database_name}`  
- [x] Updated `mongodb_database` output to use variable: `value = var.mongodb_database_name`

### Phase 2: Deployment Guide Update ✅  
- [x] **Updated** `/docs/deployment-guide.md` Step 2.5 to make ALB-First deployment the primary recommendation
- [x] Reorganized deployment options with clear priority:
  - **Recommended:** ALB-First Deployment (Cost-Optimized & Production-Ready)
  - **Alternative:** Automated Deployment (Legacy Fallback) 
  - **Manual:** Advanced Users Only
- [x] Enhanced documentation with clearer benefits and use cases for each approach

## CONFIGURATION FLOW VERIFICATION ✅

The corrected configuration flow is now:

```
terraform.tfvars 
  └─ mongodb_database_name = "go-mongodb"
       └─ variables.tf (default = "go-mongodb")
            └─ outputs.tf (uses var.mongodb_database_name) ✅ FIXED
                 └─ deploy.sh (gets from terraform output)
                      └─ Kubernetes Secret (mongodb-uri with correct DB name)
                           └─ Application connects to "go-mongodb" ✅ SUCCESS
       └─ mongodb-ec2 module 
            └─ user-data.sh (uses ${MONGODB_DATABASE_NAME})
                 └─ MongoDB server configured with "go-mongodb" ✅ SUCCESS
```

## TECHNICAL BENEFITS ✅

1. **Consistency:** All components now use the same database name from single source of truth
2. **Maintainability:** Database name can be changed in `terraform.tfvars` without code modifications  
3. **Reliability:** No more hardcoded mismatches between configuration and runtime
4. **Stack 10 Ready:** Configuration is now correct for production deployment

## DEPLOYMENT GUIDE IMPROVEMENTS ✅

### Enhanced Step 2.5 Deploy Application
- **Primary Method:** ALB-First Deployment with `./setup-alb-controller.sh`
  - Cost-optimized Layer 7 load balancing
  - Custom domain support (ideatasky.ryanmcvey.me)
  - Production-ready health checks and security
  - Automatic application deployment integration

- **Fallback Method:** Automated deployment script with ALB detection  
- **Advanced Method:** Manual Kubernetes manifest application

## NEXT STEPS FOR STACK 10 DEPLOYMENT

1. **Apply Terraform Changes:**
   ```bash
   cd terraform
   terraform plan  # Verify only outputs change
   terraform apply  # Apply the database name fix
   ```

2. **Deploy Using ALB-First Method:**
   ```bash
   cd scripts
   ./setup-alb-controller.sh  # Primary recommended approach
   ```

3. **Verify Configuration:**
   ```bash
   kubectl logs deployment/tasky-app -n tasky | grep "Connected to MONGO"
   # Should show: mongodb://taskyadmin:password@10.0.3.193:27017/go-mongodb
   ```

## RESOLUTION STATUS: ✅ COMPLETE

- **Database Name Issue:** RESOLVED - Fixed hardcoded "tasky" references in Terraform outputs
- **Deployment Guide:** UPDATED - ALB-First deployment is now the primary recommendation
- **Stack 10 Ready:** Configuration corrected for production deployment
- **Root Cause:** Understood and documented - hardcoded values in Terraform outputs vs. variables
