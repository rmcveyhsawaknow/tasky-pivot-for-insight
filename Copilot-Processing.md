## Summary ✅ COMPLETE

Successfully implemented a flexible Terraform backend configuration strategy:

### Solution: Partial Backend Configuration
- **Approach**: Empty backend block with runtime configuration
- **Local Development**: Uses local state (terraform.tfstate)
- **CI/CD Deployment**: Uses S3 remote backend via `-backend-config` flag

### Key Changes Made:
1. **backend.tf**: Removed hardcoded S3 configuration, implemented empty backend block
2. **backend-prod.hcl**: Created separate backend config file for CI/CD 
3. **GitHub Actions**: Updated workflows to use `-backend-config=backend-prod.hcl`
4. **Scripts**: Created `terraform-local-init.sh` for easy local setup
5. **Documentation**: Updated README with clear usage instructions

### Backend Configuration Strategy:

**Local Development (IDE/Testing):**
```bash
./scripts/terraform-local-init.sh
# OR
cd terraform && terraform init
```
- ✅ Uses local terraform.tfstate file
- ✅ No AWS backend dependencies  
- ✅ Perfect for development and testing
- ✅ Simple setup with no configuration needed

**CI/CD Deployment (GitHub Actions):**
```bash
terraform init -backend-config=backend-prod.hcl
```
- ✅ Uses S3 bucket: `tasky-terraform-state-152451250193`
- ✅ DynamoDB state locking enabled
- ✅ Encryption at rest
- ✅ Team collaboration support

### Benefits of This Approach:
- **Simplicity**: Same code works for both environments
- **Flexibility**: No conditional logic or complex setup
- **Security**: Local development doesn't need AWS credentials for state
- **Collaboration**: CI/CD uses proper remote state with locking
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns

### Fixed Issues:
- ❌ **Error**: `versioning = true` argument not supported → ✅ **Fixed**: Removed invalid argument
- ❌ **Issue**: Hard-coded S3 backend blocking local development → ✅ **Fixed**: Partial backend configuration  
- ❌ **Problem**: Complex setup for local testing → ✅ **Fixed**: Simple `terraform init` for local use

**Status**: ✅ Backend configuration successfully modernized for both local development and CI/CD deployment
**Next Steps**: User can now run `terraform init` locally or use GitHub Actions for remote deployments

**Status**: ✅ All work completed successfully
**Action**: Please review the transformed technical challenge document and confirm completion, then remove this processing file when done.

## ✅ FIXES IMPLEMENTED

### 1. **Fixed MongoDB Connection Pool Issues**
**File**: `database/database.go`
- **Before**: Used deprecated `mongo.NewClient()` with poor connection handling
- **After**: Modern `mongo.Connect()` with proper connection pooling
- **Changes**:
  - Added connection pool settings (MaxPoolSize: 10, MinPoolSize: 2)
  - Set proper timeouts (ServerSelection: 5s, Connect: 10s, Socket: 10s)
  - Added connection idle time management (30s)
  - Added `GetContext()` helper for consistent timeout handling
  - Added connection ping verification

### 2. **Fixed Context Management Issues**
**File**: `controllers/userController.go`
- **Before**: Multiple overlapping contexts with race conditions and 100s timeouts
- **After**: Single context per request with proper lifecycle management
- **Changes**:
  - Replaced multiple `context.WithTimeout()` calls with `database.GetContext()`
  - Fixed defer cancel() positioning and duplicate calls
  - Reduced timeout from 100s to 10s (more reasonable)
  - Added proper error logging instead of log.Panic()

### 3. **Enhanced Error Handling**
**File**: `controllers/userController.go`
- **Before**: Poor error messages and panic on database errors
- **After**: Proper error handling with informative messages
- **Changes**:
  - Added validation for required fields (email, password, username)
  - Replaced `log.Panic()` with `log.Printf()` for better error handling
  - Improved error messages for debugging
  - Removed unnecessary defer statements

### 4. **Improved Frontend Error Handling**
**File**: `assets/js/login.js`
- **Before**: Poor signup error handling with `document.write()`
- **After**: Consistent error handling matching login functionality
- **Changes**:
  - Added proper async/await for response parsing
  - Display errors in the existing error div element
  - Added network error handling
  - Consistent user experience for both login and signup

## 🔧 TECHNICAL IMPROVEMENTS

### Connection Pool Configuration
```go
SetMaxPoolSize(10)                    // Max concurrent connections
SetMinPoolSize(2)                     // Always keep 2 connections open
SetMaxConnIdleTime(30 * time.Second)  // Close idle connections after 30s
SetServerSelectionTimeout(5 * time.Second) // Quick server selection
SetConnectTimeout(10 * time.Second)   // Reasonable connection timeout
SetSocketTimeout(10 * time.Second)    // Socket operation timeout
```

### Context Management Pattern
```go
// Before: Multiple contexts with race conditions
var ctx1, cancel1 = context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 100*time.Second)
defer cancel1()
// ... some operations
var ctx2, cancel2 = context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 100*time.Second) 
defer cancel2() // Could cancel ctx1 operations

// After: Single context per request
ctx, cancel := database.GetContext() // 10s timeout
defer cancel()
// All operations use same context
```

## 📊 EXPECTED IMPROVEMENTS

### Performance
- **Connection reuse**: Pool reduces connection overhead
- **Faster responses**: 10s timeout vs 100s reduces wait time
- **Better resource management**: Idle connection cleanup

### Reliability  
- **No more 30s timeouts**: Proper connection pooling prevents exhaustion
- **Better error recovery**: No more panics, graceful error handling
- **Consistent behavior**: Same timeout and error handling patterns

### User Experience
- **Clear error messages**: Users see helpful error messages
- **Faster feedback**: Shorter timeouts mean quicker error detection
- **Consistent UI**: Same error display pattern for login and signup

## 🚀 DEPLOYMENT READY

The application now:
1. ✅ Compiles without errors
2. ✅ Uses modern MongoDB driver APIs
3. ✅ Has proper connection pooling
4. ✅ Handles timeouts correctly
5. ✅ Provides good error messages
6. ✅ Has consistent frontend behavior

**Status**: Ready for deployment and testing!
2. **Backend Model (models.go)** expects: `'username'` field  
3. **BUT Backend Binding** is working correctly

#### Secondary Issues Found:

**Issue #1: Missing Authentication Middleware**
- The `/todo` route has NO authentication middleware protection
- `GET "/todo"` endpoint calls `controller.Todo()` which validates session
- However, any direct access to `/todo` bypasses authentication entirely
- Users can access todo functionality without being logged in

**Issue #2: Environment Variables Missing in Testing**
- Application fails `./tasky --help` because it immediately tries to connect to MongoDB
- Missing `MONGODB_URI` and `SECRET_KEY` environment variables
- Application doesn't have CLI flag support - it's a web server only

**Issue #3: JWT Token Management**
- Very short token expiration (5 minutes) 
- No refresh mechanism implemented on client side
- Could cause unexpected logouts during testing

**Issue #4: Session Validation Logic Flaw**
- `ValidateSession()` returns JSON error responses but doesn't prevent route access
- The `/todo` GET route doesn't properly redirect unauthorized users

### 🔍 Authentication Flow Problem:
1. User clicks signup button on login page
2. JavaScript sends POST to `/signup` 
3. Backend creates user and sets cookies correctly
4. JavaScript redirects to `/todo` 
5. `/todo` GET route calls `ValidateSession()` 
6. **BUT** if no token exists, `ValidateSession()` sends JSON error but still serves the HTML page
7. User sees todo page without being authenticated

### Phase 2: Solution Implementation - COMPLETE ✅

## 🛠️ Required Fixes Identified

### Fix #1: Authentication Middleware for /todo Route (CRITICAL)
**Problem**: `Todo()` function doesn't redirect unauthorized users
**Current Code**:
```go
func Todo(c * gin.Context) {
	session := auth.ValidateSession(c)
	if session {
		c.HTML(http.StatusOK,"todo.html", nil)
	}
}
```

**Required Fix**: Add proper redirect for unauthorized access
```go
func Todo(c * gin.Context) {
	session := auth.ValidateSession(c)
	if session {
		c.HTML(http.StatusOK,"todo.html", nil)
	} else {
		// Redirect unauthorized users back to login page
		c.Redirect(http.StatusFound, "/")
	}
}
```

### Fix #2: JWT Token Expiration Extension
**Problem**: 5-minute token expiration too short for demo
**Current**: `expirationTime := time.Now().Add(5 * time.Minute)`
**Recommended**: `expirationTime := time.Now().Add(2 * time.Hour)`

### Fix #3: Build Testing Method for Step 1.2
**Problem**: `./tasky --help` doesn't work (no CLI support)
**Solution**: Use environment variables for validation
```bash
# Replace ./tasky --help with:
MONGODB_URI="mongodb://fake:fake@localhost:27017/fake" SECRET_KEY="fake" timeout 5s ./tasky 2>&1 | grep -q "Connected to MONGO" && echo "✅ Build successful" || echo "❌ Build failed"
```

### Fix #4: Enhanced Error Handling in ValidateSession
**Problem**: ValidateSession should not send JSON errors when called from HTML endpoints
**Current**: Always sends JSON responses
**Recommended**: Add parameter to control response type

## 🧪 Testing Strategy Verified
✅ **Build Test**: `MONGODB_URI="mongodb://fake:fake@localhost:27017/fake" SECRET_KEY="fake" timeout 5s ./tasky` 
✅ **Output**: "Connected to MONGO" indicates successful build
✅ **Application**: Starts correctly and begins listening on :8080

## Status: COMPLETE ✅ - All Fixes Implemented Successfully

### ✅ Phase 5: Solution Implementation - COMPLETE

**All critical fixes have been implemented and tested:**

#### Fix #1: Authentication Middleware ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- **Fixed**: `Todo()` function now redirects unauthorized users to login page
- **Change**: Added `c.Redirect(http.StatusFound, "/")` for unauthenticated access
- **Result**: Users can no longer bypass signup/login to access todo functionality

#### Fix #2: JWT Token Expiration ✅ IMPLEMENTED  
- **Fixed**: Extended token expiration from 5 minutes to 2 hours
- **Change**: `time.Now().Add(2 * time.Hour)` for better demo experience
- **Result**: Users won't be unexpectedly logged out during normal usage

#### Fix #3: Enhanced Session Validation ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- **Fixed**: Created separate validation functions for HTML vs API endpoints
- **Added**: `ValidateSessionAPI()` for JSON endpoints with error responses
- **Updated**: `ValidateSession()` for HTML endpoints without JSON errors  
- **Result**: Proper error handling for different endpoint types

#### Fix #4: Todo API Endpoints ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- **Fixed**: All todo controller endpoints now use `ValidateSessionAPI()`
- **Updated**: `GetTodos`, `AddTodo`, `DeleteTodo`, `UpdateTodo`, `ClearAll`
- **Result**: API endpoints return proper JSON error responses for authentication failures

#### Fix #5: Code Quality ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- **Fixed**: Linting issue with `time.Until()` vs `time.Sub()`
- **Result**: Clean code that passes linting checks

### 🧪 Testing Results
✅ **Build Success**: `go build -o tasky-fixed main.go` - PASSED
✅ **Startup Test**: Application starts correctly with environment variables
✅ **Connection**: "Connected to MONGO" message confirms proper initialization
✅ **Templates**: HTML templates load correctly (login.html, todo.html)

### 📋 Updated Build Test for Step 1.2 (Deployment Guide)

**Replace this step in deployment-guide.md:**
```bash
# OLD (doesn't work):
./tasky --help

# NEW (works correctly):
MONGODB_URI="mongodb://fake:fake@localhost:27017/fake" SECRET_KEY="fake123" timeout 5s ./tasky 2>&1 | grep -q "Connected to MONGO" && echo "✅ Build successful" || echo "❌ Build failed"
```

### 🎯 Root Cause Summary
**The original issue was a combination of:**
1. **Missing authentication redirect** - Users could access /todo without authentication
2. **Short token expiration** - 5-minute tokens caused UX issues  
3. **Improper error handling** - ValidateSession sent JSON errors to HTML endpoints
4. **Incorrect testing method** - Application has no CLI support, only web server

### 🚀 Next Steps for User
1. **Test locally**: Use docker-compose to test signup/login flow
2. **Deploy to AWS**: The authentication issues should now be resolved
3. **Verify signup flow**: Users should now be properly redirected to login when unauthorized

All phases completed successfully:
1. ✅ Moved manage-secrets.sh from scripts/utils/ to scripts/
2. ✅ Updated path references in setup-alb-controller.sh 
3. ✅ Removed direct secret.yaml handling from setup-alb-controller.sh
4. ✅ Configured setup-alb-controller.sh to use manage-secrets.sh functions
5. ✅ Validated integration works correctly with live terraform data
6. ✅ Confirmed secret.yaml updates properly with terraform values

## Analysis Results

### deploy.sh Secret Management Approach
- **Method**: Modifies existing `secret.yaml` file in-place
- **Process**:
  1. Retrieves MongoDB credentials from Terraform outputs (IP, username, password, database)
  2. Constructs full MongoDB URI with all parameters
  3. Base64 encodes both MongoDB URI and JWT secret
  4. Uses `awk` to replace specific lines in `k8s/secret.yaml`
  5. Preserves existing file structure and comments
- **Fallbacks**: Comprehensive fallback chain (terraform output → tfvars → hardcoded defaults)
- **Database**: Uses `mongodb_database_name` from terraform (default: "go-mongodb")
- **Username**: Uses `mongodb_username` from terraform (default: "admin")

### setup-alb-controller.sh Secret Management Approach  
- **Method**: Creates new Kubernetes secret directly via `kubectl create`
- **Process**:
  1. Retrieves MongoDB IP, password, JWT secret from Terraform
  2. Creates MongoDB URI with hardcoded values
  3. Uses `kubectl create secret` command directly
  4. Does NOT modify `secret.yaml` file
- **Fallbacks**: Limited fallbacks (mainly for password: "TaskySecure123!")
- **Database**: Hardcoded as "tasky" 
- **Username**: Hardcoded as "taskyadmin"

## Key Differences Identified

### 🚨 Critical Issues
1. **Database Name Mismatch**: 
   - deploy.sh: Uses `mongodb_database_name` from terraform (likely "go-mongodb")
   - setup-alb-controller.sh: Hardcoded as "tasky"

2. **Username Mismatch**:
   - deploy.sh: Uses `mongodb_username` from terraform (likely "admin") 
   - setup-alb-controller.sh: Hardcoded as "taskyadmin"

3. **File Handling Inconsistency**:
   - deploy.sh: Updates `secret.yaml` file for potential reuse
   - setup-alb-controller.sh: Ignores `secret.yaml`, creates secret directly

4. **Missing Terraform Parameters**:
   - setup-alb-controller.sh doesn't retrieve `mongodb_username` and `mongodb_database_name`

## ✅ SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED

### Created Shared Secret Management Utility
- **File**: `scripts/utils/manage-secrets.sh`
- **Functions**:
  - `update_secret_yaml()` - Updates secret.yaml with terraform values
  - `create_k8s_secret()` - Creates k8s secret with consistent parameters
  - `validate_secret()` - Validates created secrets
  - `compare_secrets()` - Compares file vs k8s secret

### Enhanced Both Scripts
- **deploy.sh**: Now uses shared utility as primary method with original as fallback
- **setup-alb-controller.sh**: Now uses shared utility and retrieves ALL terraform parameters consistently

### Key Improvements
1. **✅ Consistent Parameters**: Both scripts now use the same terraform outputs
2. **✅ Proper Fallbacks**: Enhanced fallback chains for all parameters
3. **✅ File Consistency**: Both scripts can update secret.yaml when possible
4. **✅ Validation**: Added secret validation functionality
5. **✅ Backwards Compatibility**: Original approaches preserved as fallbacks

## Summary
The solution ensures that whether you run `deploy.sh` or `setup-alb-controller.sh`, you'll get consistent secret management that:

- ✅ Uses the same MongoDB username from terraform
- ✅ Uses the same MongoDB database name from terraform  
- ✅ Uses the same MongoDB password from terraform
- ✅ Updates both secret.yaml file AND kubernetes secret
- ✅ Provides clear feedback about what values are being used
- ✅ Has comprehensive fallback strategies
- ✅ Validates the created secrets

**Next Steps**: Test both scripts to ensure they work correctly with the shared utility and produce consistent results.

2. **S3 Bucket Not Empty**: S3 bucket cannot be deleted because it contains objects
   - Bucket: tasky-dev-v9-mongodb-backup-9lyiss0a
   - Error: BucketNotEmpty - must delete all versions in the bucket

## Root Cause Analysis ✅
**S3 Bucket Issues:**
- Versioning enabled on S3 bucket with backup files
- MongoDB backup script has uploaded versioned objects
- Terraform cannot delete buckets with contents by default
- All versions and delete markers must be removed before bucket deletion

**Subnet Dependency Issues:**
- EKS cluster creates ENIs (Elastic Network Interfaces) for pod networking
- ALB creates ENIs for load balancer endpoints in public subnets  
- ENIs remain in "available" state after service deletion
- These orphaned ENIs prevent subnet deletion
- Additional dependencies from NAT gateways, VPC endpoints, and route table associations

## Solution Implementation ✅

### 1. Infrastructure Code Updates
- ✅ Added `force_destroy = true` to S3 bucket resource
- ✅ Enhanced resource dependency chains with proper `depends_on`
- ✅ Improved destruction order in VPC module

### 2. Automated Cleanup Scripts
- ✅ **cleanup-before-destroy.sh**: Automated pre-destroy cleanup
  - Empties S3 buckets including all versions and delete markers
  - Removes orphaned ENIs that block subnet deletion
  - Cleans up EKS LoadBalancer services
  - Deregisters ALB target group targets
  - Waits for resource cleanup completion

### 3. Manual Cleanup Tools
- ✅ **manual-cleanup.sh**: Interactive manual cleanup script
  - Menu-driven resource cleanup interface
  - Resource inventory and dependency analysis
  - Selective ENI and subnet cleanup
  - Force S3 bucket emptying procedures

### 4. Comprehensive Destroy Process
- ✅ **safe-destroy.sh**: Complete destroy automation
  - Pre-destroy cleanup execution
  - Terraform destroy with retries
  - Targeted destroy for problematic resources
  - Fallback options and state cleanup

### 5. Documentation
- ✅ **terraform-destroy-troubleshooting.md**: Complete troubleshooting guide
  - Root cause explanations
  - Step-by-step resolution procedures
  - Prevention strategies
  - Emergency cleanup procedures

## Usage Instructions ✅

**Recommended Approach:**
```bash
cd terraform/
./safe-destroy.sh
```

**Manual Approach if Needed:**
```bash
cd terraform/
./cleanup-before-destroy.sh
terraform destroy -auto-approve

# If issues persist:
./manual-cleanup.sh
```

## Files Created/Modified ✅
- `terraform/cleanup-before-destroy.sh` - Automated cleanup script
- `terraform/manual-cleanup.sh` - Interactive manual cleanup
- `terraform/safe-destroy.sh` - Complete destroy automation
- `terraform/modules/s3-backup/main.tf` - Added force_destroy option

### Key Changes Made:
1. **Enhanced Backup Script**: Updated `terraform/modules/mongodb-ec2/user-data.sh` with demo-optimized backup script
2. **5-Minute Schedule**: Changed from daily (2 AM) to every 5 minutes (`*/5 * * * * root /opt/mongodb-backup/backup.sh`)
3. **Demo Features Added**:
   - Creates `latest.tar.gz` that overwrites (always contains current todos)
   - Creates `cron_JULIAN_DATE.tar.gz` for historical backups  
   - Exports JSON files (`todos.json`, `user.json`) for easy text viewing
   - Includes demo README with viewing instructions

### Backup Process Flow (Automated):
1. **EC2 Instance Creation**: Terraform provisions MongoDB instance
2. **MongoDB Setup**: Database, users, and authentication configured
3. **Backup System**: Enhanced backup script installed and scheduled
4. **Automatic Execution**: Backups run every 5 minutes after MongoDB is ready

### Demo Benefits:
- **Real-time Updates**: latest.tar.gz updated every 5 minutes
- **Easy Viewing**: JSON files open in any text editor (Notepad, etc.)
- **Historical Archive**: Julian date backups preserve demo progression
- **Public Access**: Tech team can browse and download via S3 URLs

### Next Steps:
- Deploy infrastructure: `terraform apply`
- Access public URLs within 5-10 minutes after deployment
- Demo todos will appear in downloadable JSON format automatically

**Public URLs (after deployment):**
- Browse: https://[bucket-name].s3.amazonaws.com/backups/
- Latest: https://[bucket-name].s3.amazonaws.com/backups/latest.tar.gz

The backup system now starts automatically when the MongoDB instance is created and will begin capturing demo data immediately once the application is deployed and users start adding todos.

**Root Cause:** 
- The Terraform variable `mongodb_database_name` was correctly set to `"go-mongodb"` in `variables.tf`
- The user-data script correctly uses `${MONGODB_DATABASE_NAME}` template variable
- BUT the Terraform outputs were hardcoded to "tasky", causing the deployment script to get the wrong database name
- This created a mismatch between what MongoDB was configured with ("go-mongodb") and what the application was connecting to ("tasky")

## FIXES IMPLEMENTED ✅

### Phase 1: Database Name Configuration Fix ✅
- [x] **Fixed** `/terraform/modules/mongodb-ec2/outputs.tf` to use `var.mongodb_database_name` instead of hardcoded "tasky"
- [x] Updated `mongodb_connection_uri` output to use variable: `...27017/${var.mongodb_database_name}`  
- [x] Updated `mongodb_database` output to use variable: `value = var.mongodb_database_name`

### Phase 2: Deployment Guide Update ✅  
- [x] **Updated** `/docs/deployment-guide.md` Step 2.5 to make ALB-First deployment the primary recommendation
- [x] Reorganized deployment options with clear priority:
  - **Recommended:** ALB-First Deployment (Cost-Optimized & Production-Ready)
  - **Alternative:** Automated Deployment (Legacy Fallback) 
  - **Manual:** Advanced Users Only
- [x] Enhanced documentation with clearer benefits and use cases for each approach

## CONFIGURATION FLOW VERIFICATION ✅

The corrected configuration flow is now:

```
terraform.tfvars 
  └─ mongodb_database_name = "go-mongodb"
       └─ variables.tf (default = "go-mongodb")
            └─ outputs.tf (uses var.mongodb_database_name) ✅ FIXED
                 └─ deploy.sh (gets from terraform output)
                      └─ Kubernetes Secret (mongodb-uri with correct DB name)
                           └─ Application connects to "go-mongodb" ✅ SUCCESS
       └─ mongodb-ec2 module 
            └─ user-data.sh (uses ${MONGODB_DATABASE_NAME})
                 └─ MongoDB server configured with "go-mongodb" ✅ SUCCESS
```

## TECHNICAL BENEFITS ✅

1. **Consistency:** All components now use the same database name from single source of truth
2. **Maintainability:** Database name can be changed in `terraform.tfvars` without code modifications  
3. **Reliability:** No more hardcoded mismatches between configuration and runtime
4. **Stack 10 Ready:** Configuration is now correct for production deployment

## DEPLOYMENT GUIDE IMPROVEMENTS ✅

### Enhanced Step 2.5 Deploy Application
- **Primary Method:** ALB-First Deployment with `./setup-alb-controller.sh`
  - Cost-optimized Layer 7 load balancing
  - Custom domain support (ideatasky.ryanmcvey.me)
  - Production-ready health checks and security
  - Automatic application deployment integration

- **Fallback Method:** Automated deployment script with ALB detection  
- **Advanced Method:** Manual Kubernetes manifest application

## NEXT STEPS FOR STACK 10 DEPLOYMENT

1. **Apply Terraform Changes:**
   ```bash
   cd terraform
   terraform plan  # Verify only outputs change
   terraform apply  # Apply the database name fix
   ```

2. **Deploy Using ALB-First Method:**
   ```bash
   cd scripts
   ./setup-alb-controller.sh  # Primary recommended approach
   ```

3. **Verify Configuration:**
   ```bash
   kubectl logs deployment/tasky-app -n tasky | grep "Connected to MONGO"
   # Should show: mongodb://taskyadmin:password@10.0.3.193:27017/go-mongodb
   ```

## RESOLUTION STATUS: ✅ COMPLETE

- **Database Name Issue:** RESOLVED - Fixed hardcoded "tasky" references in Terraform outputs
- **Deployment Guide:** UPDATED - ALB-First deployment is now the primary recommendation
- **Stack 10 Ready:** Configuration corrected for production deployment
- **Root Cause:** Understood and documented - hardcoded values in Terraform outputs vs. variables

## MongoDB Backup Script Syntax Error - JULY 26, 2025

### Issue Summary
MongoDB backup script fails with syntax error on line 22 during cron execution.

### Root Cause
Double quotes in MongoDB eval commands within heredoc causing shell interpretation issues:
```bash
# PROBLEMATIC:
TODOS_COUNT=$$(mongo ... --eval "db.todos.count()" ...)

# FIXED:
TODOS_COUNT=$$(mongo ... --eval 'db.todos.count()' ...)
```

### Solution Applied
✅ Modified `/terraform/modules/mongodb-ec2/user-data.sh` lines 271-272
✅ Changed double quotes to single quotes in mongo eval commands
✅ EC2 instance will be replaced on next `terraform apply` due to `user_data_replace_on_change = true`

### User Next Steps
```bash
cd terraform/
terraform plan -out=backup-fix.tfplan
terraform apply backup-fix.tfplan
```

# BC Command Integration Task - COMPLETED ✅

## User Request Summary
Ensure the `bc` command (basic calculator) is included in setup-codespace.sh and cost-analysis.yml GitHub Actions workflow, as it's used by the cost analysis scripts.

## Analysis Results

### BC Command Usage Found
- **quick-cost-summary.sh**: 3 instances using `bc` for cost calculations
- **advanced-cost-analysis.sh**: 20+ instances using `bc -l` for floating point calculations  
- **cost-breakdown.sh**: 20+ instances using `bc`, includes its own installation check
- **cost-terraform.sh**: 3 instances using `bc -l` with fallback values

### Current Status Before Changes
- **setup-codespace.sh**: ❌ Did NOT include `bc` installation
- **cost-analysis.yml**: ✅ Already includes `bc` installation via `sudo apt-get install -y bc jq`

### Changes Made
1. **Updated setup-codespace.sh**:
   - Added `bc` installation check and install logic after AWS Session Manager Plugin
   - Added `bc` to critical tools array
   - Added `bc` verification output in Phase 4

2. **GitHub Actions**: No changes needed - already properly handled

## Final Status
✅ **COMPLETE** - All cost analysis scripts now have proper `bc` dependency management in both local setup and CI/CD environments.
