# Copilot Processing - Terraform Destroy Issues Resolution

## User Request
After running terraform destroy, not all resources are destroyed. Need to correct this so that all resources are destroyed properly.

## Issues Identified
1. **EC2 Subnets with Dependencies**: Three public subnets cannot be deleted due to dependencies
   - subnet-0b4e769b035a32819
   - subnet-014d02cb2b838b154
   - subnet-0594fa3ff772523f3

2. **S3 Bucket Not Empty**: S3 bucket cannot be deleted because it contains objects
   - Bucket: tasky-dev-v9-mongodb-backup-9lyiss0a
   - Error: BucketNotEmpty - must delete all versions in the bucket

## Analysis Required
- [ ] Examine current Terraform configuration structure
- [ ] Identify resource dependencies causing subnet deletion failures
- [ ] Review S3 bucket configuration and versioning settings
- [ ] Analyze ALB and EKS resource cleanup order
- [ ] Check for orphaned resources not managed by Terraform

## Action Plan

### Phase 1: Investigation and Analysis
- [x] Review main Terraform configuration files
- [x] Examine VPC module configuration
- [x] Review S3 backup module configuration
- [x] Check ALB module configuration
- [x] Analyze EKS module configuration
- [x] Identify resource dependency chain

### Phase 2: S3 Bucket Cleanup Strategy
- [x] Create script to empty S3 bucket before destruction
- [x] Add lifecycle configuration to prevent object retention
- [x] Implement force_destroy option for S3 bucket
- [x] Add versioning cleanup procedures

### Phase 3: Subnet Dependency Resolution
- [x] Identify resources causing subnet dependencies
- [x] Review ALB target groups and listeners
- [x] Check EKS node groups and ENIs
- [x] Analyze NAT gateways and route tables
- [x] Review security group dependencies

### Phase 4: Enhanced Destroy Process
- [x] Create pre-destroy cleanup script
- [x] Implement proper resource destruction order
- [x] Add retry mechanisms for dependent resources
- [x] Create manual cleanup procedures as fallback

# Copilot Processing - Terraform Destroy Issues Resolution

## User Request
After running terraform destroy, not all resources are destroyed. Need to correct this so that all resources are destroyed properly.

## Issues Identified
1. **EC2 Subnets with Dependencies**: Three public subnets cannot be deleted due to dependencies
   - subnet-0b4e769b035a32819
   - subnet-014d02cb2b838b154
   - subnet-0594fa3ff772523f3

2. **S3 Bucket Not Empty**: S3 bucket cannot be deleted because it contains objects
   - Bucket: tasky-dev-v9-mongodb-backup-9lyiss0a
   - Error: BucketNotEmpty - must delete all versions in the bucket

## Root Cause Analysis ✅
**S3 Bucket Issues:**
- Versioning enabled on S3 bucket with backup files
- MongoDB backup script has uploaded versioned objects
- Terraform cannot delete buckets with contents by default
- All versions and delete markers must be removed before bucket deletion

**Subnet Dependency Issues:**
- EKS cluster creates ENIs (Elastic Network Interfaces) for pod networking
- ALB creates ENIs for load balancer endpoints in public subnets  
- ENIs remain in "available" state after service deletion
- These orphaned ENIs prevent subnet deletion
- Additional dependencies from NAT gateways, VPC endpoints, and route table associations

## Solution Implementation ✅

### 1. Infrastructure Code Updates
- ✅ Added `force_destroy = true` to S3 bucket resource
- ✅ Enhanced resource dependency chains with proper `depends_on`
- ✅ Improved destruction order in VPC module

### 2. Automated Cleanup Scripts
- ✅ **cleanup-before-destroy.sh**: Automated pre-destroy cleanup
  - Empties S3 buckets including all versions and delete markers
  - Removes orphaned ENIs that block subnet deletion
  - Cleans up EKS LoadBalancer services
  - Deregisters ALB target group targets
  - Waits for resource cleanup completion

### 3. Manual Cleanup Tools
- ✅ **manual-cleanup.sh**: Interactive manual cleanup script
  - Menu-driven resource cleanup interface
  - Resource inventory and dependency analysis
  - Selective ENI and subnet cleanup
  - Force S3 bucket emptying procedures

### 4. Comprehensive Destroy Process
- ✅ **safe-destroy.sh**: Complete destroy automation
  - Pre-destroy cleanup execution
  - Terraform destroy with retries
  - Targeted destroy for problematic resources
  - Fallback options and state cleanup

### 5. Documentation
- ✅ **terraform-destroy-troubleshooting.md**: Complete troubleshooting guide
  - Root cause explanations
  - Step-by-step resolution procedures
  - Prevention strategies
  - Emergency cleanup procedures

## Usage Instructions ✅

**Recommended Approach:**
```bash
cd terraform/
./safe-destroy.sh
```

**Manual Approach if Needed:**
```bash
cd terraform/
./cleanup-before-destroy.sh
terraform destroy -auto-approve

# If issues persist:
./manual-cleanup.sh
```

## Files Created/Modified ✅
- `terraform/cleanup-before-destroy.sh` - Automated cleanup script
- `terraform/manual-cleanup.sh` - Interactive manual cleanup
- `terraform/safe-destroy.sh` - Complete destroy automation
- `terraform/modules/s3-backup/main.tf` - Added force_destroy option

✅ **MongoDB Backup Demo Configuration Integrated into Terraform**

The enhanced backup system with demo-friendly features has been integrated directly into the MongoDB EC2 instance creation process:

### Key Changes Made:
1. **Enhanced Backup Script**: Updated `terraform/modules/mongodb-ec2/user-data.sh` with demo-optimized backup script
2. **5-Minute Schedule**: Changed from daily (2 AM) to every 5 minutes (`*/5 * * * * root /opt/mongodb-backup/backup.sh`)
3. **Demo Features Added**:
   - Creates `latest.tar.gz` that overwrites (always contains current todos)
   - Creates `cron_JULIAN_DATE.tar.gz` for historical backups  
   - Exports JSON files (`todos.json`, `user.json`) for easy text viewing
   - Includes demo README with viewing instructions

### Backup Process Flow (Automated):
1. **EC2 Instance Creation**: Terraform provisions MongoDB instance
2. **MongoDB Setup**: Database, users, and authentication configured
3. **Backup System**: Enhanced backup script installed and scheduled
4. **Automatic Execution**: Backups run every 5 minutes after MongoDB is ready

### Demo Benefits:
- **Real-time Updates**: latest.tar.gz updated every 5 minutes
- **Easy Viewing**: JSON files open in any text editor (Notepad, etc.)
- **Historical Archive**: Julian date backups preserve demo progression
- **Public Access**: Tech team can browse and download via S3 URLs

### Next Steps:
- Deploy infrastructure: `terraform apply`
- Access public URLs within 5-10 minutes after deployment
- Demo todos will appear in downloadable JSON format automatically

**Public URLs (after deployment):**
- Browse: https://[bucket-name].s3.amazonaws.com/backups/
- Latest: https://[bucket-name].s3.amazonaws.com/backups/latest.tar.gz

The backup system now starts automatically when the MongoDB instance is created and will begin capturing demo data immediately once the application is deployed and users start adding todos.

**Root Cause:** 
- The Terraform variable `mongodb_database_name` was correctly set to `"go-mongodb"` in `variables.tf`
- The user-data script correctly uses `${MONGODB_DATABASE_NAME}` template variable
- BUT the Terraform outputs were hardcoded to "tasky", causing the deployment script to get the wrong database name
- This created a mismatch between what MongoDB was configured with ("go-mongodb") and what the application was connecting to ("tasky")

## FIXES IMPLEMENTED ✅

### Phase 1: Database Name Configuration Fix ✅
- [x] **Fixed** `/terraform/modules/mongodb-ec2/outputs.tf` to use `var.mongodb_database_name` instead of hardcoded "tasky"
- [x] Updated `mongodb_connection_uri` output to use variable: `...27017/${var.mongodb_database_name}`  
- [x] Updated `mongodb_database` output to use variable: `value = var.mongodb_database_name`

### Phase 2: Deployment Guide Update ✅  
- [x] **Updated** `/docs/deployment-guide.md` Step 2.5 to make ALB-First deployment the primary recommendation
- [x] Reorganized deployment options with clear priority:
  - **Recommended:** ALB-First Deployment (Cost-Optimized & Production-Ready)
  - **Alternative:** Automated Deployment (Legacy Fallback) 
  - **Manual:** Advanced Users Only
- [x] Enhanced documentation with clearer benefits and use cases for each approach

## CONFIGURATION FLOW VERIFICATION ✅

The corrected configuration flow is now:

```
terraform.tfvars 
  └─ mongodb_database_name = "go-mongodb"
       └─ variables.tf (default = "go-mongodb")
            └─ outputs.tf (uses var.mongodb_database_name) ✅ FIXED
                 └─ deploy.sh (gets from terraform output)
                      └─ Kubernetes Secret (mongodb-uri with correct DB name)
                           └─ Application connects to "go-mongodb" ✅ SUCCESS
       └─ mongodb-ec2 module 
            └─ user-data.sh (uses ${MONGODB_DATABASE_NAME})
                 └─ MongoDB server configured with "go-mongodb" ✅ SUCCESS
```

## TECHNICAL BENEFITS ✅

1. **Consistency:** All components now use the same database name from single source of truth
2. **Maintainability:** Database name can be changed in `terraform.tfvars` without code modifications  
3. **Reliability:** No more hardcoded mismatches between configuration and runtime
4. **Stack 10 Ready:** Configuration is now correct for production deployment

## DEPLOYMENT GUIDE IMPROVEMENTS ✅

### Enhanced Step 2.5 Deploy Application
- **Primary Method:** ALB-First Deployment with `./setup-alb-controller.sh`
  - Cost-optimized Layer 7 load balancing
  - Custom domain support (ideatasky.ryanmcvey.me)
  - Production-ready health checks and security
  - Automatic application deployment integration

- **Fallback Method:** Automated deployment script with ALB detection  
- **Advanced Method:** Manual Kubernetes manifest application

## NEXT STEPS FOR STACK 10 DEPLOYMENT

1. **Apply Terraform Changes:**
   ```bash
   cd terraform
   terraform plan  # Verify only outputs change
   terraform apply  # Apply the database name fix
   ```

2. **Deploy Using ALB-First Method:**
   ```bash
   cd scripts
   ./setup-alb-controller.sh  # Primary recommended approach
   ```

3. **Verify Configuration:**
   ```bash
   kubectl logs deployment/tasky-app -n tasky | grep "Connected to MONGO"
   # Should show: mongodb://taskyadmin:password@10.0.3.193:27017/go-mongodb
   ```

## RESOLUTION STATUS: ✅ COMPLETE

- **Database Name Issue:** RESOLVED - Fixed hardcoded "tasky" references in Terraform outputs
- **Deployment Guide:** UPDATED - ALB-First deployment is now the primary recommendation
- **Stack 10 Ready:** Configuration corrected for production deployment
- **Root Cause:** Understood and documented - hardcoded values in Terraform outputs vs. variables
