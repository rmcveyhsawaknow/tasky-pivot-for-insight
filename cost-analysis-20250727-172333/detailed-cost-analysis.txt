COST OPTIMIZATION OPPORTUNITIES
================================================================
1. EKS Node Groups - Use Spot Instances:
   - Current Cost: $72.00/month
   - With Spot (70% discount): $21.60/month
   - Monthly Savings: $50.40

2. MongoDB Instance - Right-sizing:
   - Current: t3.medium ($36.00/month)
   - Alternative: t3.small ($36.00/month)
   - Potential Savings: $0.00/month

3. Development Environment Scheduling:
   - Stop non-prod resources outside business hours
   - Potential Savings: 60-70% for dev/test environments

4. S3 Backup Optimization:
   - Use S3 Intelligent Tiering
   - Implement lifecycle policies
   - Potential Savings: 20-40% on backup storage
