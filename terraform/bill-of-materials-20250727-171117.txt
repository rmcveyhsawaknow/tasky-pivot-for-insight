NOTES:
=======================================================
- Costs are estimates based on us-east-1 pricing
- Actual costs may vary based on usage patterns
- Data transfer costs not included
- Backup storage costs may vary based on retention
- EKS cluster cost is fixed at $72/month regardless of usage
- EC2 and ALB costs are based on 24/7 operation

=======================================================
COST OPTIMIZATION RECOMMENDATIONS:
=======================================================
- Use Spot instances for EKS nodes (50-70% savings)
- Implement auto-scaling for EKS nodes
- Use S3 Intelligent Tiering for backups
- Consider using EKS Fargate for specific workloads
- Monitor and right-size instances based on actual usage

=======================================================
COST COMPARISON: Traditional vs Cloud-Native ALB
=======================================================

BEFORE (Dual ALB Setup):
- Terraform-managed ALB: $22.50/month
- Kubernetes-managed ALB: $22.50/month
- Total ALB costs: $45.00/month

AFTER (Cloud-Native Setup):
- Kubernetes-managed ALB only: $22.50/month
- Monthly savings: $22.50
- Annual savings: $270.00

ARCHITECTURE BENEFITS:
- 50% reduction in ALB costs
- Simplified infrastructure management
- Better integration with Kubernetes services
- Automatic target group management
